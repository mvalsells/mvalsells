### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Marc Valsells, a big fan of networks and just a fan of computers. In my GitHub profile I am uploading code that someone asked me to share for them, my personal projects (for now not much since I don't have time, but things are coming ðŸ™ƒ). You can check my website at [valsells.me](https://valsells.me)
