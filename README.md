### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Marc Valsells, a big fan of networks and just a fan of computers. In my GitHub profile I am uploading code that someone asked me to share for them, my personal projects (for now none since I don't have time, but things are coming ðŸ™ƒ) and my university projects. For more details about me you can check my website [valsells.me](valsells.me).

##### University projects
The repos starting with LS are projects that I had to do for some university subjects while coursing the degree in telematics engineering and the degree in computer engineering at La Salle BCN. Most of this projects are done in group with some collegues which they have commits in their name to. After the LS in the repo name comes the subject and finally the project name.
- **LS-DPOO:** Project made in Object-Oriented Design and Coding (Java)
